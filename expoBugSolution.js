The solution to this kind of error depends on its root cause.  There's no single fix. Here are some common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Clean the project:**
```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo start
```
2. **Check native module versions:** Make sure that all native modules used in your project are compatible with the Expo SDK and with each other. Consult the documentation for any native modules you are using to check their compatibility with your current setup.
3. **Examine your package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock):** Look for conflicting versions of packages that could lead to compatibility issues. Consider reinstalling dependencies or using a package manager like yarn or npm to ensure consistent dependency resolutions. 
4. **Simplify your app:** Temporarily remove any unnecessary libraries to help isolate the problem. Gradually add libraries back in to pinpoint the culprit.
5. **Examine EAS Build logs:** If you're using EAS Build, carefully examine the logs; they sometimes provide more specific details on the build failures.  Follow EAS Build's troubleshooting guidelines.
6. **Test on different devices/simulators:** Build and run your application on different physical devices and emulators to determine if it's a device-specific problem related to native modules. 
7. **Reinstall native modules:** In some cases, reinstalling potentially problematic native modules (after carefully cleaning the project) can resolve these errors.  Be sure to check if there are updated versions available.

If the problem persists, provide the full error message from the Expo CLI build output for further debugging.  Consider providing the output from `expo diagnostics` for better context.
