# Expo CLI Build Failure: Cryptic Native Module Error

This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose error in Expo CLI builds. The error message from the build process usually doesn't directly identify the root cause, making debugging challenging.

The `expoBug.js` file shows a simplified example of an app that might trigger this type of error (though the specific cause will vary depending on the used native modules).

The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates possible solutions and troubleshooting steps, such as:

* **Checking native module versions:** Ensuring compatibility between native modules and the Expo SDK.
* **Resolving dependency conflicts:** Identifying and resolving conflicting versions of native modules.
* **Cleaning the project:** Running `expo prebuild --clean` and rebuilding.
* **EAS Build troubleshooting:** Following the troubleshooting steps in the EAS Build documentation.
* **Testing on different devices/simulators:** Ruling out device-specific problems.
