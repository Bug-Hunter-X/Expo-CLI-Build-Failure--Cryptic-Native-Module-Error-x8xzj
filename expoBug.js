This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the native modules required by your Expo app and the native modules available on the device or simulator where you're running it.  It often manifests during the build process, particularly when using EAS Build or building for a specific device.

For example, consider a scenario where your app uses a library that relies on a specific version of a native module (like a camera library or a mapping library). If that module's version isn't compatible with the Expo SDK version or the device's operating system, this error may result.  Other possible issues could include issues with linked native libraries and dependency conflicts.
